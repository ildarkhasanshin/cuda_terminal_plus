Plugin for CudaText.
"Terminal Plus" gives Terminal emulation, it's continuation of plugin "Terminal".
On Linux (maybe other Unixes too) it supports colored output in terminal.
On Windows colors are not supported, because it's not needed much
(only few PowerShell commands give colored output).

Plugin gives its panel in the CudaText bottom panel.
Plugin shows its own statusbar (inside its panel) with cells for all opened terminals.
Additionally plugin shows buttons on CudaText sidebar, one button per terminal.
Ie it shows 2 equal rows of buttons, but it may be useful if CudaText sidebar is hidden.


Mapping of terminals
--------------------
Plugin maps its terminals to documents: it remembers which terminal is opened
for which document. "Toggle focus" command does this:

- from named document, if it has terminal(s) attached - puts focus to attached terminal;
- from untitled document - does nothing;
- from terminal attached to some document - puts focus to document;
- from 'free' terminal (in OS home dir) - does nothing.

CudaText command "Save as" is not handled, new file name will be without terminals.


Plugin commands
---------------
- "Open": activates Terminal panel (it initially doesn't have terminals)

- "Add terminal for user home directory": adds 'free' terminal, not attached to any document
  (opens in user's home directory)
- "Add terminal (for current file)": adds terminal attached to current named document
  (one document may have multiple terminals)

- "Rename terminal": allows to set caption of terminal for plugin's statusbar

- "Close terminal": closes currently focused terminal (it may be 'free' terminal)
- "Close last terminal for current file"
- "Close all terminals"

- "Focus next terminal"
- "Focus previous terminal"

- "Toggle focus: editor - its terminal": switches focus between current document
  and its last attached terminal.
  If current document doesn't have terminals, do nothing.
  If current terminal is 'free', do nithing.

- "Execute selected text in terminal".
  Ignores multi-line selection.
  Ignores multi-carets.
  If no selection, runs current line and moves editor caret to the next line.

- "Search for command in history": in the plugin's input field (below the
  terminal output), shows menu of all recent commands,
  filtered by currently typed text.


Plugin features
---------------

Plugin loads ~/.bashrc if Bash is used, so Bash aliases must work.

Output of interactive programs like 'less' or 'git diff':
- listing can be scrolled, but only down, with Down and PageDown keys
- to stop interactive program, enter command "q" (with Enter)

Plugin shows special cells in the statusbar:
- "+": runs command "Add terminal for current file"
- "X": runs command "Close all terminals"

In the plugin's statusbar, cells are sorted:
- first: 'free' terminals without a file
- with editor tabs opened (these are sorted by order of their UI tabs)
- last: terminals for files without an UI tab (closed files)

Colored lines on the terminal cells show:
- bright line on top - selected terminal
- bright line at the bottom - terminal for currently selected document
- dark line at the bottom - to separate terminals for different documents
- red line at the bottom - terminal's document is current not opened in CudaText

Context menu for plugin's statusbar cells allows:
- to rename terminal
- to change its icon
- to change its wrap mode
- to close it

Custom icons (resolution of 20x20) may be placed into CudaText directory
"data/terminalicons". This folder is searched additionally to plugin's folder.

Terminals are restored after app restart, the state is saved to file
"cuda_terminal_plus_state.json" in the CudaText "settings" folder.
